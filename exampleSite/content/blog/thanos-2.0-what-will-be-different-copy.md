## **What’s happening in HackBio and in the world of bioinformatics?**

**Thanos 2.0 so far**: Thanos 2.0 is like no other. At every stage, we are fazed with the question of maintaining superior standards for knowledge acquisition, intentional learning, real-world applications, and projects. This challenge becomes even greater when you think about the fact that we are giving everyone the opportunity to explore their personal scientific interests. To solve the challenge, we continue to innovate at every stage. Basically, we use innovative learning, teamwork, collaborative problem solving amongst others to keep the fellows on the edge of learning. Some of the exotic highlights include:

* **Reinvent the wheel:** The common parlance is to not reinvent the wheel. However, bioinformatics and other tech skills generally benefit from reinventing the wheel when it comes to capacity development. Reproducing another person’s project positions our fellows to think and analyze data, just like the pros that did the original project. The experience is in itself thought-provoking. 99% of the time, we reproduced the exact results and on a few occasions, we have had reasons to doubt the published results.
* **Resource Sharing:** Resource sharing is very important to creating a vast knowledge base. In a world of superfluous information, coordinating and sharing the most important information is critical to joint development and building resilient learning ecosystems
* **Press Conference:** Probably the most interesting thing we did over the week. It was a time to turn scientists into politicians and journalists. Talk about your upcoming projects in 5 minutes, (no presentations), and let’s ask you interesting questions. It was a healthy learning environment for all of us, diversity of thoughts at its peak and importantly, we all learned.
* **Moment of Truth:** Even though you work with a team, it's important for us to know you are learning, building capacity, supporting others, and doing something significant that contributes to the real project your team is working on. The HackBio team, including Thanos, meets you one on one for a private discussion/interview to talk about your progress. We have also learned and received short feedbacks in this space as well, and we are confident of this batch of bioinformaticians we are releasing.

Although it may be time-consuming, 90% of HackBio fellows have confessed the time was worth it. Why don't you also take this one-off investment in building capacity? [Get started here](https://thehackbio.com/)
