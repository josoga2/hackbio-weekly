## **Early results from the Nigerian 100K genome project suggests we may not be so diverse (TLDR)**

The Nigerian 100K genome project is as complete as 70% in terms of sample collection. One of the key collaborators for this project is the fast-rising African Health Giant, 54gene. Presenting at the American Society for Human Genetics Conference, Colm O'Dushlaine (PhD) talked about the strides achieved so far with respect to data analysis. \~1% of target data suggests Nigerians may not be so diverse genetically.

You can imagine having 50 major ethnic groups that can only be resolved into 7 genetic groups. In fact, what makes these clusters different is not clear.

This pops some interesting questions:

* Is the Nigerian genome truly diverse as we have suggested initially?
* What implications could the potentially "not so diverse" genome of the most populous black nation have on continental Africa?
* Can Nigeria expect precision medicine faster than anticipated?

In any case, we think Nigeria and Africa at large still need to continue to collect more samples for sequencing. With more data, intelligence increases, and directions become clear. Going forward, big data is imminent. Is the available bioinformatics talent enough to “slice the data” into information? With one qualified bioinformatician available for 10 openings, we think the gap is still wide. To bridge this gap, HackBio will continue to churn out highly skilled bioinformatics talents. Watch out for future editions of our newsletter for our Conversion Survey Report (2020-2021).
