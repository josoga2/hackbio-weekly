## **On Scheduling**

Adulthood is a scam. It seems like what we have to do is unending. From working to handling school to running a business to taking online classes…aah! We become so busy that a lot of the time the important things we’re supposed to do are left unattended.

Here are some helpful tips on how to get better at managing school/work/life with the demands of HackBio Internship 😉.

* **Schedule your time in advance** ⏱️: Yes, we all have 24 hours daily, no more no less! Think ahead of what your week should look like. On Saturdays and Sundays, the burden of the internship is less, use this time to plan the week. In fact, you can use your google calendar 📅 + google tasks ✔️ (Our CTO, [Wale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adewale-joseph-ogunleye-09029684) also uses this).
* **Dedicate your peak performance hours to your important tasks ☕**: If you work best/fastest in the morning, do the most important tasks in the morning.
* **Give yourself breaks 😴**: If you don’t take a break, you will break down. It is as simple as that. In fact, we encourage you to sleep deep and well. It's important for a healthy mind
* **Expect to use more time than scheduled ⌛**: You are not a robot, even though we try to focus and dedicate as much energy and attention, there are seconds/minutes of distractions that take more time than we expect.
