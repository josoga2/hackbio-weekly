## **Thanos 2.0! What will be different?**

Thanos 2.0 is the second edition of the HackBio internship in the year 2021. This is our first time doing 2 internships in a year, and it has come with its own opportunities and challenges. Well, things are a bit different this time and going forward. Thanos 2.0 comes with:

* Dedicated Teaching Assistants
* Cloud compute servers ([GCP](https://cloud.google.com/))
* Real Research Projects (publication-worthy)
* Abstract submission in at least one international conference
* Round the clock office hour
